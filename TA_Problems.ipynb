    "### Problem 1: Conditional Probability with Poisson and Exponential Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Word Problem\n",
    "A civil engineer is monitoring traffic flow at a busy intersection. The number of vehicles passing through the intersection follows a Poisson distribution with an average rate of $\\lambda = 5$ vehicles per minute. The time between consecutive vehicles passing through the intersection follows an exponential distribution. What is the probability that exactly 4 vehicles pass through the intersection in the first minute, given that no vehicle has passed in the first 10 seconds?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Workflow\n",
    "1. **Identify the known parameters:**\n",
    "   - $\\lambda = 5$ vehicles per minute for the Poisson distribution.\n",
    "   - The time between arrivals follows an exponential distribution with rate parameter $\\lambda = 5$ per minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate the probability of no vehicles passing in the first 10 seconds:**\n",
    "   - Use the Exponential distribution's CDF to find the probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Determine the probability of exactly 4 vehicles passing in the first minute:**\n",
    "   - Use the Poisson distribution to calculate this probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use conditional probability:**\n",
    "   - Apply the definition of conditional probability to combine the two probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Solution:**\n",
    "   - Compute the final probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Math Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(X = 4 \\mid T > 10) = \\frac{P(X = 4 \\text{ and } T > 10)}{P(T > 10)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $T$ is the time until the first vehicle arrives.\n",
    "- $X$ is the number of vehicles in 1 minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exponential Distribution for $P(T > 10)$:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(T > 10) = e^{-\\lambda \\cdot t} = e^{-5 \\cdot \\frac{10}{60}} = e^{-\\frac{5}{6}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Poisson Distribution for $P(X = 4)$:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(X = 4) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^4}{4!} = \\frac{e^{-5} \\cdot 5^4}{24}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Final Probability:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(X = 4 \\mid T > 10) = \\frac{e^{-\\frac{5}{6}} \\cdot \\frac{e^{-5} \\cdot 5^4}{24}}{e^{-\\frac{5}{6}}} = \\frac{e^{-5} \\cdot 625}{24}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Word Problem\n",
    "A construction company claims that the average compressive strength of concrete used in their projects is at least 5000 psi. A sample of 30 concrete specimens is tested, yielding a sample mean of 4900 psi and a standard deviation of 200 psi.
